Ensure you have text boxes named txtCredit1, txtCredit2, ..., txtCredit5 for credit hours and txtGrade1, txtGrade2, ..., txtGrade5 for grades. Also, there should be a button named btnCalculate to trigger the GPA calculation, and a label named lblGPA to display the calculated GPA. Adjust the control names according to your UI design.
